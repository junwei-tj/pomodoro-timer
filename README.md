# pomodoro-timer
Assignment from The Odin Project

Task: Create a Pomodoro clock

Reflections:
- Rather straightforward, despite untaught skills being required here
- Need to get better at web design (the creative part, not the syntax part)
- I realise it would be easier to implement a timer using classes, but since it wasn't taught (yet?) I took a less efficient approach
